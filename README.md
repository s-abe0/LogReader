# LogReader
Simple c++ program written for Linux systems that will read log files (or any file, really) as it is being written to. 
Very nice for system administration (which is why I wrote it); watching log file contents as something is happening. 
Nice for FTP servers; just open a Terminal and run the program with the FTP service log file to watch what users are doing
or to debug an FTP service.
